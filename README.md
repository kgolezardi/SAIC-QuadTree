## How To Use
After you made your python 3 virtual enviroment, install the required packages by:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you just need to run `main.py` and you're done:
```bash
python main.py
```
The result will be stored at `out/test.svg`.

## How To Contribute
### Random Division
The grids are generated by a custom random division algorithm. You can create yours by
simply creating a python file under `divisions` directory and extend the `Division` class by
implementing the `devide` abstract method. Then you import `*` from file in `divisions/__init__.py`
so that you can access it in `main` simply by importing your class from `divisions`.

The `gerenate_grids` method in `main` recieves the algorithm class as an attribute.

### Shapes
To create a new type of shape, you have to extend `Shape` in `shapes.py` and implement its
abstract method, `draw`. Note that you should draw that shape according to the position given
as an attribute (it means that the size of your shapes may vary).

After creating your own shape, simply add it to `shapes` list in `main.py`. Each item in this list
is in the form `(ShapeClass, Bias)`. Bias is an arbitary value which should be set according to the
frequency of the shape you wanna use and also according to the bias of other shapes.
